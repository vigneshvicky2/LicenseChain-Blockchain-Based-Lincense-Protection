        <h1>Welcome to LicenseChain</h1>
        <p>
            LicenseChain is a blockchain-based solution for protecting software and game licenses. By leveraging the immutable and transparent nature of blockchain technology, LicenseChain ensures that each license issued is securely recorded and verifiable, preventing unauthorized use or duplication.
        </p>
        <p>
            Our system works by creating a unique block in the blockchain for every license generated. This block contains crucial information such as the license key, software ID, user ID, and optional metadata. Each block is securely hashed and linked to the previous block, forming an unalterable chain of records that is resistant to tampering. When a user attempts to validate their license, the system checks the blockchain to verify the authenticity and validity of the license, ensuring that only legitimate users can access the software.
